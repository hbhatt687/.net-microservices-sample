.NET Microservices Example


A sample app that sets up two .NET based microserves for getting Platforms and Commands for those Platforms.
* Built two .NET Microservices using the REST API pattern
* Worked with dedicated persistence layers for both services
* Deployed these services to Kubernetes cluster
* Employed the API Gateway pattern to route to our services
* Built Synchronous messaging between services (HTTP & gRPC)
* Built Asynchronous messaging between services using an Event Bus (RabbitMQ)

Future Improvements:

* Introduction of HTTPS/TLS
* Revisit Event Processor/Eventing
* More elaborate use-case
* Service Discovery
